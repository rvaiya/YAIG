Purpose:

	A simple way to preview and view image files in a web directory.
	
Dependencies:

	The script requires vanilla perl (no extra modules needed)
	and imagemagick to be installed on the server 
	(convert must be available). 

	*The directory must also be writable by the user which owns the CGI process*.

Installation:

	Move src/pictures.cgi to a directory containing image files, and access it in the browser
	(ensure that the directory is writable by the user running the CGI process.)

Demo:
