Purpose:

	A script which generates a simple html image gallery. Uses css3 transformations and
	animations for the loading glyph, and pure javascript (no jQuery) for image
	loading/event handling.
	
Dependencies:

	The script requires vanilla perl (no extra modules needed)
	and the convert binary of image magick to be in the path.

Usage:
	
	Make "bin/gengal.pl" executable and run it from a directory containing image
	files. Redirect the output to the desired gallery page. 
	
	E.g "./gengal.pl > index.html"
